# How to make a pull request

Please make all pull requests to the `develop` branch, not the `master` branch.
Coding standards are PSR2-tabs.

# Before posting an issue

- If a command is failing, post the full output you get when running the command, with the `--verbose` flag
- If everything looks normal in said log, provide a log with the `--pretend` flag
